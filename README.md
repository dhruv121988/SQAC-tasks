# 🌟 SQAC-Tasks – Frontend Web Projects Collection by Dhruv Sarkar

Welcome to **SQAC-Tasks**, a collection of beginner-to-intermediate-level web development projects built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, along with **Firebase** and multiple **public APIs**.  
This repository demonstrates my hands-on learning journey in front-end development, covering UI/UX design, API integration, and dynamic data handling.

Each project highlights a different use case — from admin data visualization to real-time currency conversion and interactive movie searching.
